# Laravel Task Manager

A modern task management system with drag-and-drop functionality and project organization.

## Setup with AWS Database

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/task-manager.git
cd task-manager
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
composer install
npm install
```

3. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Set up these AWS database credentials in `.env`, the database is already hosted on AWS EC2, no need to create on local:

```env
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=52.87.148.108
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=taskManager
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=Chhibba/123456
```

5. Generate application key

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

6. Since the database is already set up on AWS, you can skip migrations.

7. Start the application

```bash
# In one terminal
php artisan serve

# In another terminal
npm run dev
```
