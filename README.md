## Technical Architecture

This application uses:

-   Server-side rendering with Laravel Blade templates
-   AJAX for dynamic updates without page reloads
-   jQuery for handling AJAX requests
-   SortableJS for drag-and-drop functionality
-   No frontend build process required

All interactions (create, update, delete, reorder) happen through AJAX calls, providing a smooth user experience while maintaining the simplicity of server-side rendering.

## Database Visualization

You can view and interact with the database using any MySQL database viewer (like DBeaver):

1. Open DBeaver or your preferred MySQL viewer
2. Create a new MySQL connection with these credentials:
    - Host: 52.87.148.108
    - Port: 3306
    - Database: taskManager
    - Username: root
    - Password: Chhibba/123456

This will allow you to:

-   View table structures
-   Execute SQL queries
-   Monitor database changes
-   View relationships between tables
